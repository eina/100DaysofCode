# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: Jan 18th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in Day 1 of Daily CSS Images!

**Thoughts**: Messier than I would've liked, I should stop drawing with CSS so late at night. I also want to learn how to do 1-div CSS drawings.

### Day 2: Jan 17th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my landing page for my Codevember projects.

**Thoughts**: My original plan was to use iframes in modals to display my projects, but that didn't turn out as I expected. For some reason, my blend mode project wasn't working? Will probably still want to implement this in the future

### Day 1: June 16th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Copied + edited my Codevember projects from Codepen to my landing page.

**Thoughts** CodePen is wonderful, but I really should back up the stuff I build on there just in case.
