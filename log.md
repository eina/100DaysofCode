# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: Jan 31st, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Finished most of the pomodoro clock's functionality!

**Thoughts**: Used the Date() object for my pomodoro clock and the basic functionalities (start/pause/reset) are finished. It's fairly simple right now, but I have decided that I don't want to make the timer switch automatically before

### Day 7: Jan 31st, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked portfolio

**Thoughts**: I noticed that my portfolio needed some tweaking on mobile so made a list and implemented them!

### Day 6: Jan 30th, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Started Pomodoro Timer

**Thoughts**: ... I hope it's cool that I'm just continuing from 10 days ago. I had to take a little break to do other personal things. Life happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyway! I watched Simon Allardice's intro to JS videos on Lynda and was inspired to start this FCC project. 

Decided I have to use the Date object instead though.

### Day 5: Jan 20th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Images Day 3 

**Thoughts**: Today I learned more about stacking orders with z-index, especially when you use transform: rotate. Took a bit of my time but [this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20851452/z-index-is-canceled-by-setting-transformrotate) was really helpful with understanding that. Just goes to show you that when you think you understand something completely, you probably missed something.

### Day 4: Jan 19th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Images Day 2

**Thoughts**: I wanted to do something more complicated + animate it but didn't end up having enough time to do it :'(. It's okay, I quite like how this elephant guy turned out. I'm really proud of how I managed to make the folded in look for the trunk too. CSS is cool.

### Day 3: Jan 18th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in Day 1 of Daily CSS Images!

**Thoughts**: Messier than I would've liked, I should stop drawing with CSS so late at night. I also want to learn how to do 1-div CSS drawings.

### Day 2: Jan 17th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my landing page for my Codevember projects.

**Thoughts**: My original plan was to use iframes in modals to display my projects, but that didn't turn out as I expected. For some reason, my blend mode project wasn't working? Will probably still want to implement this in the future

### Day 1: June 16th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Copied + edited my Codevember projects from Codepen to my landing page.

**Thoughts** CodePen is wonderful, but I really should back up the stuff I build on there just in case.
